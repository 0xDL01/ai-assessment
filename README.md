# 🦁 DemonLion AI Readiness Assessment

**Live Demo:** 🔗 [https://0xDL01.github.io/ai-assessment/](https://0xDL01.github.io/ai-assessment/)

## ⚙️ Overview
The **DemonLion AI Readiness Tool** helps organisations instantly assess their AI maturity across five industry-standard pillars:

- 🧭 **Strategy** – Alignment of AI with business goals  
- 🧮 **Data** – Quality, accessibility, and governance  
- ⚙️ **Technology** – Infrastructure, APIs, and MLOps maturity  
- 👥 **People** – Skills, culture, and enablement  
- 🛡️ **Governance** – Security, ethics, and responsible AI practices  

Unlike generic surveys, this tool provides:
- 📊 Real-time weighted scoring & visual radar chart  
- 🧠 Contextual reasoning explaining *why* each score matters  
- 🧰 Actionable **tool suggestions** with estimated DIY/enterprise pricing  
- ⚡ 100% client-side (no backend) — privacy-safe and fast

---

## 💡 Why This Matters
Most “AI Readiness Assessments” only output a score.  
**DemonLion’s approach goes further:**
- Explains *how major companies think about readiness*  
- Suggests *exact automations or small AI projects* suitable for that company  
- Provides *real cost options* and *contact routes* for larger builds  

This prototype demonstrates the **transition from advisory → actionable automation** — the next generation of AI consultancy.
